# ParalellPromises

In this project I explore the concept of paralell promises and implement a method for executing a list of promises with a determined concurency limit.
This project is inspired by https://itnext.io/node-js-handling-asynchronous-operations-in-parallel-69679dfae3fc

## Usage
Just launch this commaand and you will see a set of promises ranging from 1 to 10 seconds interacting in paralell
```Shell
npm start
```
